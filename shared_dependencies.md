The shared dependencies in the "AutoCodeAIApp.py" file include:

1. Imported Libraries: The file imports the `tkinter` and `ttk` libraries from Python's standard library. These libraries are used for creating the graphical user interface of the application.

2. Class Name: The file defines a class named `AutoCodeAIApp` which inherits from `tk.Tk`. This class is the main application class.

3. Instance Variables: The `AutoCodeAIApp` class has two instance variables, `self.code_input` and `self.code_output`, which are both instances of `tk.StringVar`. These variables are used to store the user's input and the generated code respectively.

4. Function Names: The `AutoCodeAIApp` class defines several methods including `__init__`, `create_input_field`, `create_output_field`, `generate_code`, and `generate_code_from_input`. These methods are used to initialize the application, create the input and output fields, generate the code based on the user's input, and implement the code generation logic respectively.

5. Event Binding: The `input_entry` widget binds the `<KeyRelease>` event to the `self.generate_code` method. This means that the `generate_code` method is called every time a key is released in the `input_entry` widget.

6. Main Execution: The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the application when the script is executed directly. It creates an instance of the `AutoCodeAIApp` class and starts the main event loop.
